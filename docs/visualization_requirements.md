## Prioritized Visualization Features

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Basic metrics visualization (rewards, losses)
2. Simple environment rendering
3. Training progress charts
4. Experiment comparison views

### Phase 2: Enhanced Visualization
1. Interactive simulation viewers
2. Advanced metric visualizations

## Integration with Existing Systems

The visualization system will integrate with:
1. The configuration system (using YAML/JSON configs)
2. Experiment runner (for data collection)
3. Agent implementations (for behavior tracking)
4. Environment implementations (for state rendering)

This integration will leverage the existing architecture while extending it with visualization capabilities.
