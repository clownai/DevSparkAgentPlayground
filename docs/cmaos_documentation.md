## Implementation Details

### TeamRegistry

The TeamRegistry component manages team compositions, role definitions, and agent assignments. It provides methods for:

- Creating and managing teams
- Defining roles with required capabilities
- Adding and removing agents from teams
- Retrieving team and role information

```javascript
// Example: Creating a team
const team = await teamRegistry.createTeam({
  name: 'Analysis Team',
  description: 'Team for data analysis tasks',
  roles: ['coordinator', 'analyst', 'executor']
});

// Example: Adding an agent to a team
await teamRegistry.addAgentToTeam(
  team.id,
  'agent1',
  'coordinator',
  { planning: 0.9, coordination: 0.8 }
);
```

### CollectiveIntelligence

The CollectiveIntelligence component implements mechanisms for group decision-making and insight aggregation. It provides:

- Voting systems with different strategies (majority, weighted, consensus)
- Methods for aggregating insights from multiple agents
- Confidence-weighted decision making

```javascript
// Example: Creating a vote
const vote = await collectiveIntelligence.createVote({
  topic: 'Solution Approach',
  description: 'Deciding on the best approach for solving the problem',
  options: ['Approach A', 'Approach B', 'Approach C'],
  method: 'weighted',
  participants: ['agent1', 'agent2', 'agent3']
});

// Example: Casting votes
await collectiveIntelligence.castVote(vote.id, 'agent1', 'Approach A', 0.9);
await collectiveIntelligence.castVote(vote.id, 'agent2', 'Approach B', 0.7);
await collectiveIntelligence.castVote(vote.id, 'agent3', 'Approach A', 0.8);

// Example: Getting vote result
const result = collectiveIntelligence.getVoteResult(vote.id);
```

### NegotiationProtocol

The NegotiationProtocol component facilitates bidding, resource allocation, and conflict resolution. It provides:

- Task bidding mechanisms
- Resource negotiation protocols
- Conflict resolution strategies

```javascript
// Example: Creating a task bidding
const bidding = await negotiationProtocol.createTaskBidding({
  name: 'Data Analysis Task',
  description: 'Analyze customer data for patterns',
  roles: ['analyst', 'data_engineer'],
  biddingStrategy: 'highestConfidence'
});

// Example: Submitting a bid
await negotiationProtocol.submitBid(
  bidding.taskId,
  'analyst',
  'agent1',
  {
    confidence: 0.9,
    estimatedTime: 120,
    resources: { cpu: 2, memory: 4 }
  }
);

// Example: Closing bidding
const result = await negotiationProtocol.closeBidding(bidding.taskId);
```

### CollaborationManager

The CollaborationManager component manages collaboration templates, workflows, and task progress. It provides:

- Task creation and management

      id: 'step3',
      name: 'Strategy Formulation',
      roles: ['strategist'],
      dependencies: ['step2']
    }
  ]
});

// Example: Completing a step
await collaborationManager.completeStep(
  task.id,
  'step1',
  {
    summary: 'Data collection completed',
    details: 'Collected market data from 5 sources',
    artifacts: ['market_data.json']
  }
);
```

// Example: Creating a team message
const teamMessage = messageProtocolExtended.createTeamMessage(
  'agent1',
  'team1',
  'team.update',
  { status: 'in-progress', completion: 0.5 }
);

// Example: Creating a role message
const roleMessage = messageProtocolExtended.createRoleMessage(
  'agent1',
  'analyst',
  'team1',
  'request',
  { action: 'analyze', data: { source: 'market_data.json' } }
);

// Example: Broadcasting to a team
await agentCommunicationExtended.broadcastToTeam(
